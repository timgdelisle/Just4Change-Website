<h2>Why this package?</h2>
<p><a href="http://just-4-change.com/S4C">Strip4Change</a> puts together the efforts of a photographer and participants.  Each member of the party has five pictures taken where piece of clothing comes off in each snapshot. Then the actual fundraiser begins. With every one hundred dollars raised a new picture is published until the ultimate fifth picture is reached for that participant.  This fundraising solution has proven extremely successful raising nearly four thousand dollars on its first go.</p>
<h2>Who Should participate?</h2>
Strip4Change participants have an extensive social network and a large entourage that supports them in reaching their goals. They are willing to do anything in for their cause and expose themselves to expose the problems they want to solve.
<h2>Who donates?</h2>
<p>People who donate to Strip4Change are generally part of the participant's entourage mainly, their family and friends. What is unique about this fundraiser is that it tends to elicit donations younger and older generations.</p>
