<h2>Why this package?</h2>
<p><a href="http://just-4-change.com/F4C">Fashion4Change</a> is a flexible solution that allows the participant to cater the solution to his or her needs. With this fundraiser we provide opportunities for the youth to stimulate their entrepreneurial leadership by putting them in control of a fundraiser for a cause that they choose. We also sell our products directly on our website as well as in some select stores where you choose to donate to the non-profit of your choice at the point of purchase.</p>
<h2>Who Should participate?</h2>
<p>Anyone who likes to sell, is in touch with fashion or simply wants to buy a good looking accessor, should definately check out this package.</p>
<h2>Who donates?</h2>
<p>Often times the donations come directly from people who purchase our products but also from the entourage of the kids who choose to take on their own projects.</p>
<h2>Social Entrepreneur Program?</h2>
<p>In our entrepreneurship program we supply you with the jewelry inventory of your choice, which you then must sell in support of your cause. If you are an educational organization or individual student who would like to participate please contact us at: J4C.Contact@gmail.com.</p>
