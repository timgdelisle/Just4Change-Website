<h2>Why this package?</h2>
<p><a href="http://just-4-change.com/L4C"style="color: #5BC8E7">Likes4Change</a> allows different non-profit groups to collect sufficient funds to set up a project of their own. With Likes4Change, participants have the opportunity to participate in the development of a short video of a maximum of 5 minutes allowing them to briefly explain their project and why they need donations. A single or a group of corporate sponsors donate up to one dollar for each like the video receives. These videos simultaneously create exposure for the cause as well as create an advertising opportunity for corporate sponsors. </p>
<h2>Who Should participate?</h2>
<p>This service can be particularly useful for those who have a creative side they want to put to the test by participating in the creation of a video that is both original and informative.</p>
<h2>Why would a company donate?</h2>
<p>Companies would donate to causes they care for to show their support as well as increase their social responsibility profile, which has a growing importance for today's consumer.</p>
