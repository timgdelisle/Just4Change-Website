<h2>Who we are</h2>
<p>Just4Change is a non-profit organization seeking to facilitate fundraising for other charities and non-profits. We accomplish this by providing easy to use fundraising packages to their volunteers. We first started by doing a fundraiser to help one of our co-founders raise money for a cause we hold dear to our hearts. After a creating an innovative high return fundraiser which came to be known as Strip4Change, we started exploring different opportunities to help others raise money as well as shared our successful Strip4Change formula. </p>
<p>When you order from us you get a comprehensive solution guaranteed to generate returns. All costs are funnelled back into Just4Change in order to maintain or operations as well as going into our scholarship fund for our volunteers and volunteers' children's education.</p>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>At Just4Change we strive to help others raise money for their cause by providing easy-to-use, high-return fundraisers and help both our volunteers and the people we provide fundraisers for have a lasting impact in their community. </p>
